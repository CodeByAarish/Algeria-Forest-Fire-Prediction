ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Prediction using Polynomial Regression
This project aims to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using environmental and weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall, and fire indices. The model is trained using Polynomial Regression for better accuracy on non-linear relationships.

âœ… Overview
Forest fires can cause devastating environmental damage and threaten lives and property. This project predicts the Fire Weather Index (FWI), which helps in assessing the risk of forest fire in a specific region based on several weather and fuel-related variables.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
Given real-time weather and forest condition data, predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) â€” a key indicator used by environmental authorities to understand how likely a forest fire is to occur.
