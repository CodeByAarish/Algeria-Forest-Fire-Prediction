# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction using Polynomial Regression

Welcome to the **Forest Fire Prediction System** — a smart machine learning project designed to help assess and prevent the risk of forest fires using real-time weather and environmental data.

---

## 🌟 About the Project

Forest fires can spread rapidly and devastate ecosystems. Early prediction of fire-prone conditions is **crucial**.

This project uses **Polynomial Regression** to predict the **FWI (Fire Weather Index)** — a numerical indicator that represents the potential for forest fires based on several environmental features.

## 📊 Features Used

Below are the key input variables used for prediction:

| 🔢 Feature         | 📘 Description |
|--------------------|----------------|
| 🌡️ `Temperature`   | Air temperature in Celsius (°C) |
| 💧 `RH`             | Relative Humidity in percentage (%) |
| 🌬️ `Ws`            | Wind speed in km/h |
| ☔ `Rain`           | Rainfall in mm |
| 🔥 `FFMC`           | Fine Fuel Moisture Code (dryness of leaves/grass) |
| 🌲 `DMC`            | Duff Moisture Code (moisture of loosely compacted organic material) |
| 🌳 `DC`             | Drought Code (moisture of deep compact organic matter) |
| 🌀 `ISI`            | Initial Spread Index (expected fire spread rate) |
| 📈 `BUI`            | Build-Up Index (total amount of fuel available for burning) |
| 🗺️ `Region`         | Area code (1 = Bejaia, 2 = Sidi-Bel Abbes) |
| 🚨 `Classes`        | Binary flag: 1 = Fire occurred, 0 = No fire |
